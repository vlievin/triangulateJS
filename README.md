# triangulateJS

This is a simple Javascript project made during my free time, just for fun. Therefore, writting clean code was the last of my concerns.

This simple app transform any image into polygon art (the image is drawn only with triangles).
The script use edges detection features from jsfeat (developped by Eugene Zatepyakin / http://inspirit.ru/) and the fast Delaunay Triangulation (developped bu Ironwallaby / https://github.com/ironwallaby/delaunay).

You can also find the python project here: https://github.com/vlievin/Triangulr (simple Flask app)
